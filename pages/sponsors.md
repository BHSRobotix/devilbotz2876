      <h4>Financial Sponsors and Grant Makers</h4>
      <p>
        Team 2876 can't build a robot without tools and parts. We can't go to competitions without travel expenses. In 2017, several long-time sponsors reduced, discontinued, or changed the qualifications for their giving. As a result, Team 2876 <strong>needs more financial sponsors!</strong> Would your company like to have its logo on our robot and here on this page? Please <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/about/contact/">Contact Us!</a>

            <p>We rolled into the picture in 1998, going back, in order to move forward. Since then, the Flatbread Company has been introducing people to the magic of earth and fire, and how that combination can produce incredible tasting pizza.</p>
