    <div>
      <strong>Arshad Khan</strong> serves not only as 2876's Head Mentor, but also as a math teacher here at Burlington High School. When he's not busy posing for the camera or creating lesson plans for his motley calculus, geometry, and algebra classes, Arshad facilitates the club's business endeavors, creates regular meeting agendas, and assists the mechanical team with their daily tasks. Arshad also takes care of buying new parts and re-supplying our team's limited stocks whenever necessary. Zealous about Robotics and even more enthusiastic about instructing, Arshad taught an “Introduction to Robotics” course for the first time in 2015-16. This course, offered as an elective to all grades, serves to inspire the next generation of robot-enthusiasts.

    </div>
    <div><strong>Maciej Wiczynski</strong> has been our programming team's Head Mentor ever since 2876's first few days. With his extensive knowledge of Java and his years of experience working for Oracle, Mr. Wiczynski is undoubtedly an integral asset to our club. Passionate yet methodical, Mr. Wiczynski is usually the first to bring the entire club together to discuss specific details regarding prototyping, driving, and finally constructing our robot. Mr. Wiczynski cares deeply about the process taken to get to a final answer; getting the correct answer simply does not cut it for him. His unique style revolves around empowering his mentees: whenever they are presented with a formidable challenge (such as a bug in the code), he lets them experiment and attempt to solve the problem themselves before chiming in with one of his many helpful hints.</div>

    <div>From running the scouting team to teaching team members how to code, <strong>Rick O'Donnell</strong> has many responsibilities. When teaching HTML to team members, Mr. O'Donnell leads them to reach their own conclusions, helping them in the long run. Mr. O'Donnell is adept at combining different ideas, leaving everyone happy. When he is not helping at Robotics, Mr. O'Donnell is working hard for Akamai. He enjoys spending time with family, playing board games, and volunteering at his church. Mr. O'Donnell is a big fan of the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Syracuse Orangemen.</div>

    <div><strong>Eleanor O'Neill</strong> is a retired software engineer (CyberGrants). She has been mentoring the DevilBotz since 2013. She previously mentored with BERT 133 in Maine for three years. Eleanor particularly likes the competition because "it's a team sport, but for nerds like me." Ms O'Neill has a varied background including Editorial Assistant; Graphic Design and Prepress; teaching graphic software to designers and art students; administering computer networks; and then transitioned into a web-based (SASS) software career using a variety of languages: perl, PHP, Java, Python, React and more; as well as an affinity for databases. She has a passion for space exploration.</div>

    <div>
      <strong>Dean Casciola</strong> helps work with the electrical team to wire the robots, install sensors, and teach the programming team how to use the sensors properly. Outside of Robotics, Dean is retired from Delta Electronics Manufucturing Corp as an Electrical Engineer. Dean has a pilot license and in his spare time flies airplanes, including one he built from a kit. He joined Robotics because his son got him involved in the club and he developed an interest as an electrical mentor. He is married to Ms. O'Neill.</div>

    <div><strong>Nilesh Agarwalla</strong> has been an embedded software engineer at Broadcom's Broadband Video Group for 16+ years. He started mentoring in Oct 2021 and hopes his cross-discipline experience in hardware, firmware, and software will benefit the team. His experience with robotics started in college when his team built a "heat seeking robotic killer ant" which included mechanicals, a custom circuit board, IR sensors, and custom firmware. He was also instrumental in the hardware design for MIT's 2000 6.270 Autonomous Robot Design Competition's robot kit (BotKit). Nilesh shares the mentoring team's philosophy of focusing on "the process" and making sure the students do not settle for just the "what," but also understand the "how" and the "why."</div>
