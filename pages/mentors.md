          <strong>Arshad Khan</strong> serves not only as 2876's Head Mentor, but also as a math teacher here at Burlington High School. When he's not busy posing for the camera or creating lesson plans for his motley calculus, geometry, and algebra classes, Arshad facilitates the club's business endeavors, creates regular meeting agendas, and assists the mechanical team with their daily tasks. Arshad also takes care of buying new parts and re-supplying our team's limited stocks whenever necessary. Zealous about Robotics and even more enthusiastic about instructing, Arshad taught an “Introduction to Robotics” course for the first time in 2015-16. This course, offered as an elective to all grades, serves to inspire the next generation of robot-enthusiasts.

        </div>
        <div><strong>Maciej Wiczynski</strong> has been our programming team's Head Mentor ever since 2876's first few days. With his extensive knowledge of Java and his years of experience working for Oracle, Mr. Wiczynski is undoubtedly an integral asset to our club. Passionate yet methodical, Mr. Wiczynski is usually the first to bring the entire club together to discuss specific details regarding prototyping, driving, and finally constructing our robot. Mr. Wiczynski cares deeply about the process taken to get to a final answer; getting the correct answer simply does not cut it for him. His unique style revolves around empowering his mentees: whenever they are presented with a formidable challenge (such as a bug in the code), he lets them experiment and attempt to solve the problem themselves before chiming in with one of his many helpful hints.</div>

        <div>From running the scouting team to teaching team members how to code, <strong>Rick O'Donnell</strong> has many responsibilities. When teaching HTML to team members, Mr. O'Donnell leads them to reach their own conclusions, helping them in the long run. Mr. O'Donnell is adept at combining different ideas, leaving everyone happy. When he is not helping at Robotics, Mr. O'Donnell is working hard for Akamai. He enjoys spending time with family, playing board games, and volunteering at his church. Mr. O'Donnell is a big fan of the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Syracuse Orangemen.</div>

        <div><strong>Nilesh Agarwalla</strong> has been an embedded software engineer at Broadcom's Broadband Video Group for 16+ years. He started mentoring in Oct 2021 and hopes his cross-discipline experience in hardware, firmware, and software will benefit the team. His experience with robotics started in college when his team built a "heat seeking robotic killer ant" which included mechanicals, a custom circuit board, IR sensors, and custom firmware. He was also instrumental in the hardware design for MIT's 2000 6.270 Autonomous Robot Design Competition's robot kit (BotKit). Nilesh shares the mentoring team's philosophy of focusing on "the process" and making sure the students not settle for just the "what", but also understand the "how" and the "why."</div>

        <div><strong>Michael Malec</strong> joined our Robotics team in December 2013. He was stationed at Hanscom Air Force as a test flight engineer at the time, and became a major addition from the day he joined our team. The Devilbotz have greatly benefited from his introduction of group management, brainstorming tactics, and other major concepts. Outside of robotics, Mike enjoys a variety of activities, such as running, biking, skiing, hiking, and rollerblading. As Mike always says, "Don't start counting 'till after it hurts." The team is sad that "Military Mike" left us after the 2015-2016 season.</div>

        <div>
          <strong>Lawrence Chiodi</strong>, a Burlington High Alumni, was with Team 2876 for upwards of three years, assisting the electrical team with anything and everything they need help with. Mr. Chiodi worked as both a Design Engineer and an Engineering Manager. Currently, he holds the position of Field Applications Engineer at Renesas Electronics, one of our past amazing sponsors. He is extremely knowledgeable both in and out of his field, and was truly an integral member of our team.</div>

        <div><strong>Gerry Pothier II</strong> was a mechanical mentor and oversaw team logistics. A mentor of Team 2876 from 2009-2018, Mr. Pothier has seen many students learn the FIRST principles and go on to college working toward degrees in science and technology. He firmly believes that Robotics helps build a well rounded student prepared for the real world. He believes that everyone on the team has a voice; no one was ever left out on his watch.</div>

        <div class="col-md-3"><img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/mentor_roberta.jpg" data-fancybox alt="Former mentor Rob Pothier" width="300" /></div>
        <div><strong>Roberta Pothier</strong> was a behind-the-scenes mentor for many years. After realizing how important robotics was to her son Gerry, she became more involved by helping the Devilbotz get noticed within the community. Several years ago, Roberta and Gerry started a robotics program at the Francis Wyman Elementary School for 5th graders. For Roberta and her husband Gerry, it goes without saying robotics is a family affair. The Pothiers' vision has always been to help robotics programs permeate the Burlington community and inspire students of all ages to an interest in engineering.</div>
