The 2025 Reefscape season has officially started! On January 4th, 2025 we had our Kick-Off, a meeting where the whole team gets together to watch FIRST display the challenge for this year. This year's challenges is based on strengthening an underwater ecosystem.

Unlike last eyar's competition when robots had to shoot notes into tall structures called speakers, this year, the main way to score points is by placing coral (pipes) on the reef. Of course, this is just one way to score points. Our team is working on the best possible strategies to strengthen our chances of winning. Fortunately, we have had many new members join with their unique ideas! We're excited to see what this year's challenge and team members have to offer. 

Make sure to check in next week for a new update!
