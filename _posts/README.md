DevilBotz website is running on Github Pages (https://docs.github.com/en/pages), built by Jekyll using a fork of Jekyll-now repository by Barry Clark (https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) that was built to help create blogging sites.

Members of the Business github group can edit and create pages for the new site. Here's quick instructions:

-Go to the 'blog' directory in the repository and open the 'blog-template.md' file. Copy all of the text there.
-Go to the '_posts' directory and create a new file. Paste the blog template text
-Name the file in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD-[title of the blog post].md', for example: 2022-02-12-jacks-coal-fired.md
-Update all the top matter to match what you're creating. Don't change the 'layout' line. The category (for now) should just be the year. 
-Change the Author line as appropriate
-Write your blog post using markdown format (https://www.markdownguide.org/)
-You may include valid HTML in your post as well, but for most blogs, it shouldn't be needed.
-Please start with an introductory paragraph before including any videos or images.
-Commit your changes and push
-Check the /blog page and visit your post to make sure it looks the way you expect it to.

** Assets

Website images are currently part of the devilbotz2876 repository. They should be hosted elsewhere, as this constitutes more filespace than free github pages are supposed to use. 
Website videos should all be loaded on a Youtube channel that some members of the team can contribute to. The channel @burlingtondevilbotz has been created and Shadman, Shefali, and Dylan can upload to it. Mr. Khan owns the channel and Eleanor is also a manager.
