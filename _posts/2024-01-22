 This Saturday we tested out the field element called the speaker. The initial goal was to shoot the orange ring into the speaker's opening successfully. Each time the ring wouldnt make it into the speaker, they would change the distance in which it was being shokoted at. After many trail and errors the ring managed to land inside the speaker.
 Most of the food for this weeks Saturday meet were donated from the parents who were generous enough to donote some items to us.A big thanks to those parents who gave us food for this week, we greatly apreaciate it! The main coarce was a variaty of pizza's from Blaze Pizza.Some of the items the parents gave where a salad,fruits,motzorella sticks,wraps anmd sandwhiches.
