 This Saturday we tested out the field element called the speaker. The initial goal was to shoot the orange ring into the speaker's opening successfully. Each time the ring wouldnt make it into the speaker, they would change the distance in which it was being shokoted at. After many trail and errors the ring managed to land inside the speaker.

 Most of the food for this weeks Saturday meet were donated from the parents who were generous enough to donote some items to us.A big thanks to those parents who gave us food for this week, we greatly apreaciate it! The main coarce was a variaty of pizza's from Blaze Pizza.Some of the items the parents gave where a salad,fruits,motzorella sticks,wraps anmd sandwhiches.

 The team activity for this week was a scavenger hunt. The scavenger hunt was a great success! The business team worked together to build and function it. We hid timy pieces of paper either labeled as "candy!!" or "coal". Everyome was split into teams where they would wokr together to look for the markers as well  as individualy working to find the papers. The team with the most markers got a prize of candy canes and depending on how many peices of paper labeled "candy!!" they had collected they would the same amount of candy.
