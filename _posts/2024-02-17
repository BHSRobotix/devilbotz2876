The mechanical team has been working hard and diligently this week to accomplish their goals for this week. They have finished assembling the swerve robot and are currently working on building the competition robot. They've also done the electrical work for the swerve robot which includes things like wiring. Something their also working on is coordinating time for the usage of the robot. This is a struggle because it is hard for them to build on the robot when the software team might need it as well.

The software team has been working on coding the drive system for the robot. They have also been searching for a code to use for the vision camera. The vision camera is what will help the robot be able to find its target so it makes shooting the notes easier. Something else they have been doing this week is finding QR codes as well as autonomous.

The members of the strategy team have been deciding finalists for the drive team. They have also been scouting alliances and have heard back from three teams! Along with that, they are evaluating potential drivers and deciding who is best fit for this job.

A struggle CAD is currently facing is trying to decipher how to make the intake wider without it hitting other parts. Something they are doing to fix this problem is trying to create a new intake design that might solve this problem for them. They are also working on putting climbers into the main robot,

The business team has started doing raffles this week. Members of the business team have been going around to local businesses in Burlington and asking if they would like to be a part of the raffle. Along with raffles they have also been creating the bot for the stickers and working together to make more buttons. Something else they did this week was repainting the number signs used for competitions.
