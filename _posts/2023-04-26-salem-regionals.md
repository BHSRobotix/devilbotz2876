Just like that, we are in our first week of the robotics competition. We are very stoked to have our first competition on March 4, 2023. The crowds are roaring, the snow is storming, and we are going to run two days of matches in one day. Everybody was bummed out that we had to stay for such a long day but stoked to see how everything turned out. Our first four matches went poorly. After our driver Adi refueled with a meal we won the next four, which put us in 34th place. Boom, just like that it was lunchtime. We had an interesting lunch which included Ceaser salad and a very interesting pasta dish. No comment there. After lunch, we went back to our qualification rounds and we did pretty well. At the end of our qualification matches, we were in 14th place. Everybody was excited that all the qualification matches were over but also kind of worried that we had elimination rounds and we didn't know what would happen. In order to play in the finals, we would need to be picked by another alliance and that scared everyone. 

We are in alliance selection and the suspense starts. Teams started to get called and we just hoped that 2876 would be one of teams selected. After teams were called down, team 2876 was called. Overly Komplex proceeded to ask our mascot, Abhay, who was in a devil costume if team 2876 would like to join their alliance. Abhay with his charming, delicious, fabulous looks and uses what this generation calls rizz said "I heard you wanted to make a deal with the devil, team 2876 accepts". Just like that, team 2876 is back and ready for action

Adi was starving and not fed enough which impacted his performance. We lost our first match and just like that we lost our second one but, we were so close. Now we are fully out of the competition. We go back home and we review what went right and what went wrong and now to prepare for our week 3 competition in Reading.
