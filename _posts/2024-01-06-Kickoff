The 2024 First Robotics Competition Crescendo was released to all robotics teams. The Robotics team today watched the Crescendo video by Haas Game Animation and brainstormed ideas for the robot. The robotics team had lunch and went straight to work. The team has already made a strategy plan and started discussing it in groups. There is a lot of work to get done for the competition season.
