our new favorite team-building activity: Real Life Connections. For those of you who don't know Connections, it is a game made by the New York Times. The original game consists of 16 random words which are then put into 4 categories. Each category contains 4 words that have something in common. The categories can be anything from capital cities to simply words that rhyme. The player must decide which words on their screen should be sorted into which categories/  The player has 4 tries to complete this puzzle. If more than 4 mistakes are made, the game will end and the categories will be revealed to them.

Our real-life version of the NYT online game had the same idea, but of course, we made a few changes. First, similar to the online game, we made 4 categories: Sharp Objects, Decorative Items, Stationary Items, and Mini Objects. From there, we found objects that fit in those categories such as school supplies, desk toys, and Barbie items. Then we handed out the boxes to the five teams  with around 7 people on each team. The members of business team walked around the room to assist any team that needed help or wanted us to check their answers. The game took roughly 15 minutes and in that time two teams got the correct answer.
