Throughout this week the software teams worked on multiple different tasks. Nilesh Agarwalla a mentor of the software team. He mentioned how the team is currently working on getting the practice tank robot ready for drive practice. What's interesting though is seeing if the software actually works in reality! The is also trying to update the software accordingly as well as trying to get it to work with the motors.

Alex and Sanjith in Design and CAD are proactively collaborating together to create the arm of the robot in CAD. The most fascinating and intriguing thing about CAD and Design is that the whole robot design is actually in CAD!! They are also working on CADing the quokka (the shooter). Members of CAD use a software program to design the layout of the robot.

 This whole week Abhay has been tirelessly working on setting up a challenging and engaging obstacle course for a drive team practice. During the drive team practice, they have members of the team operate driving the robot in order to see who best achieves the standards for this demanding role. The students driving the robot must maneuver the robot through the cones and obstacles to reach the end.

The fabulous members of the Business team have been taking on many different tasks this week. Some of the tasks include button making, sticker making, interviewing, and blogging!! The hardest and most time-consuming task for them is button making. The team is expected to make roughly a thousand buttons or more. Although button-making takes up much of their time, interviewing is also a key role in order to achieve a successful blog!

Mechanical is an integral part of this team!! As we interviewed Arnesh we were able to accumulate more information on their strategy for assembling the robot. The most alluring part of this team is the hefty power tools. Some of the accomplishments of this team include creating the quokka shooter and arm. A challenge they have faced is prototyping on the bot. They are also working on testing professionals on the shooter.
