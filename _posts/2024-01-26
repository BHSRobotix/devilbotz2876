Along this week we have seen multiple different tasks and software programs. First off, we get introduced to the software by Nilesh Agrawala, mentor of the software team. He mentions how he is currently working on getting the practice tank robot ready for drive practice. But what is really interesting is seeing if the softwre actually works in reality!

Continuing so forth, we move onto Alex and Sanjith in Design and CAD! They are in the process of creating the arm of the robot in CAD. We see Alex and Sanjith having fun with the whole robot designing process. 

Strategy! It is! a life! skill! to attain! Drive practice, doing an obstacle course, being involved. These are all important factors in team friendship with Abhay. In the driving test, they see which members of the team is the best at driving precisely and maneuvering.
