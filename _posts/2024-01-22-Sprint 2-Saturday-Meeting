This Saturday we tested out the field element called the speaker.The initial goal was to shoot the orange ring into the speaker's opening successfully. Each time the ring wouldn't make it into the speaker, they would change the distance it was being shot. After many trials and errors, the ring managed to land inside the speaker.

Most of the food for this week's Saturday meet was donated by generous parents.A big thanks to those parents who gave us food for this week, we greatly appreciate it! The main course was a variety of pizzas from Blaze Pizza. Some of the items the parents gave were a salad, fruits, mozzarella sticks, wraps, and sandwiches.

The team activity for this week was a scavenger hunt. The scavenger hunt was a great success! The business team worked together to build and function it. We hid tiny pieces of paper either labeled as "candy!!" or "coal". Everyone was split into teams where they would work together to look for the markers as well as individually to find the papers. The team with the most markers got a prize of candy canes and depending on how many pieces of paper labeled "candy!!" they had collected they would have the same amount of candy.
