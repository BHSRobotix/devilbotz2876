<p>Today was the last Saturday meeting of the build season! The team worked hard and weâ€™re looking forward to our first competition in Reading on March 18th. We met with a new partner, <em>Nothing Bundt Cakes</em>. Ricky was a very kind guy and helped us immediately. The place was very cozy and beautiful and the cakes were even better. Next, we went to <em>Regina Pizzeria</em> and grabbed some delicious cheese pizza. We worked with a lot of different places this season, and we hope to continue next year!</p>
