      <h4>Financial Sponsors and Grant Makers</h4>
      <p>
        Team 2876 can&#8217;t build a robot without tools and parts. We can&#8217;t go to competitions without travel expenses. In 2017, several long-time sponsors reduced, discontinued, or changed the qualifications for their giving. As a result, Team 2876 <strong>needs more financial sponsors!</strong> Would your company like to have its logo on our robot and here on this page? Please <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact/">Contact Us!</a>
