        <h1>FIRST LEGO League</h1>
        <p>We build a robot, but we also build our community. After our rigorous build season, we mentor elementary school students at Francis Wyman Elementary school. We recognize that it is imperative to educate our youth in STEM related fields.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The best way to summarize <em>FIRST</em>LEGO League is to say that it is a robotics program for 9 to 16
            year olds (<strong>9 to 14 in US/CAN/MEX</strong>), which is designed to get children excited about science
            and technology &#8212; and teach them valuable employment and life skills. FLL can be used in a classroom
            setting but is not solely designed for this purpose. Teams, composed of up to ten children with at least one
            adult coach, can also be associated with a pre-existing club or organization, homeschooled, or just be a
            group of friends who wish to do something awesome.</p>

      <p>When Burlington Pride Day and the Fourth of July Parade at the Burlington Town Common come around, we showcase our robot as part of a fun community program. We drive around our robot, explain our build process, and talk about our club with intrigued onlookers all in the name of fun.</p>
